    <h2><u>what is the introduction of math?</u></h2>
    <p> <mark>Mathematics</mark>, often abbreviated as math, is the study of <b>numbers, quantities, shapes, and
         patterns</b>.It is a fundamental discipline that explores the properties and relationships of abstract 
         structures and the logical processes of reasoning.<mark>Math</mark> is not just a subject studied in 
         school;<q><u>it is a universal language used to understand and describe the world around us.</u></q>.</p>
    <p><b><mark>Mathematics</mark></b><u>is more than just numbers and equations; it is a powerful tool that
         helps us understand and shape the world.</u>Whether you're calculating your monthly budget,
          designing a bridge, or developing software,<b>math</b> plays a crucial role in our everyday lives.</p>

<h2><u>Introduction to Chemistry</u></h2>
<p><mark>Chemistry</mark><u>is a branch of science that studies the substances that make up matter, 
their properties, interactions, and the changes they undergo.</u>It bridges other natural sciences,
 including <mark><u>physics, biology, and geology, and provides</u></mark>a foundational understanding 
 for numerous applied sciences.</p>
<p><mark>Chemistry</mark>is an essential science that not only helps us understand the composition
     and behavior of matter but also provides practical solutions to real-world <del>Whether you're 
        curious about the chemical reactions in your body or the materials that make up our world,
         chemistry offers fascinating insights and applications.</del></p>
